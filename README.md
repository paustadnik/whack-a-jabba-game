Description
A simple game where the objective is to hit a randomly appearing object. For each successful attack, player is awarded one point. If an incorrect object is hit, 3 points are deducted. The goal is to get as many points as possible and the win/lose behaviour is based on the final number of points. User is urged to enter their name and top 3 scores are saved in local storage. 

MVP

- to have the object of Jabba the Hutt appear from a randomly selected dune and if user hits the object in time, one point is awarded
- to have a splash screen with instructions
- to have a win/lose logic based on the number of points
